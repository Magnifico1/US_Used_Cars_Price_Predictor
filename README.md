# US_Used_Cars_Price_Predictor

In this project we used data on US Used Cars available from Kaggle.com, which includes information on 65 aspects of nearly 3,000 used cars. The objective was to determine which of these features had some bearing on car price and followingly to be able to use them to predict the price of each car accurately such that, with information on any given car, we could predict its price. we sought to predict the list price from a subset of the other attributes related to the cars' features. In order to achieve this, we explored the structure of the data, identified a small number of attributes that could plausibly correlate well with price, split the data into training and test sets, performed data cleaning to feed the models usable data, 
selected and trained a variety of Supervised Machine Learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest regression, and evaluated their performance on the test data to determine which one made the most accuract predictions.
