# US_Used_Cars_Price_Predictor

Using data on US Used Cars available from Kaggle.com we sought to predict the list price (the attribute price) from a subset of the other attributes related to the cars' features. In order to achieve this, we explored the structure of the data, identified a small number of attributes that could plausibly correlate well with price, split the data into training and test sets, performed data cleaning to feed the models usable data, 
selected and trained a few models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest regression , and evaluated their performance on the test data.

 investigated the US Used Cars dataset, which includes information on 65 aspects of nearly 3,000 used cars. The purpose of this project was to determine which of these features had some bearing on car price and followingly to be able to use them to predict the price of each car accurately such that, with information on any given car, we could predict its price. We train a variety of supervised machine learning models to determine which one makes the most accuract predictions.
